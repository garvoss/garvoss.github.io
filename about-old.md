Welcome, wanderer.

The goals of this blog is multifold. 

The first, to showcase some of the problems I've encountered. 

The second, to improve my skills in copywriting, important in penetration testing.

And lastly, to help unravel the depths of information security to those come seeking to understand.

With that said, I'll leave you to your journey.

Happy hacking.
